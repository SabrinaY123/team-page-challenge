## Overview

![screenshot](/images/my-team-page-screenshot.png)

- Where can I see your demo?
 
  My demo is available at the link provided above!

- What was your experience?

  It was fun! Definitely more challenging than a 404-not-found page!
 
- What have you learned/improved?

  I have definitely learned alot more about the different techniques of positioning elements on your page. I have vastly improved in my knowledge of flexbox and absolute & relative positioning.

- Anything you plan on improving on?

  I definitely plan on understanding responsive positioning a bit better. I feel like I could have achieved this result with less lines of code. I will probably come back when I have improved and have a code refactoring session!

- Your wisdom? :)

  Start in sections and tackle one puzzle piece at a time. By the time you know it, you will have completed your entire project!
